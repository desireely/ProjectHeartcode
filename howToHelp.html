        Learn to Recognize the Signs of Anxiety
      </h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Knowing the signs of anxiety can help you realize when someone you love is having fearful thoughts or feelings. Symptoms vary from person to person but can be broken into three categories:

          <img src="dizziness.png" width="100px" height="100px">
          <h3 class="fw-normal mt-3">Physical Symptoms</h3>
          <p>Some of the physical symptoms your loved one may report feeling include: lightheadedness, sweating, nausea, feeling edgy and/or restless, shortness of breath, diarrhea and getting easily fatigued</p>

          <h3 class="fw-normal mt-3">Anxious Behaviors</h3>
          <p>Perhaps what you’ll notice most is your loved one’s behaviors. Common anxiety behaviors include: avoidance of feared situations or events, seeking reassurance, second-guessing, irritability and frustration in feared situations and compulsive actions (like washing hands over and over)</p>

          <h3 class="fw-normal mt-3">Anxious Thoughts</h3>
          <p>People with anxiety often have thought patterns such as: believing the worst will happen, persistent worry, all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralizing (making overall assumptions based on a single event)

        Responses based on love and acceptance, and the desire to see your loved one get better, are the cornerstones of helping someone with anxiety. Consider the following approaches:

      <div class="col-md-7">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Provide Validation</h2>
        <p class="lead">Many different things can make people anxious. Saying something like, “I can’t believe you’re getting upset over such a small thing” belittles a person’s experience. Instead, ask your loved one how you can provide support during challenging moments. What makes one person fearful may be no big deal to someone else. One's anxiety doesn’t have to make sense to you so it’s important to understand that what the person is experiencing is real and requires sensitivity.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Express Concern</h2>
        <p class="lead">“It’s hard to see a loved one having an anxiety attack but in the moment, there’s not too much you can do to shorten the duration or noticeably lower the intensity of a panic attack. When you start to notice your loved one withdrawing from activities that they used to enjoy, you don’t have to cover up your concern. Instead, it can be helpful to approach your loved one in a warm and positive way. You can start a dialogue by saying you’ve noticed certain behavior changes. </p>
        
        <p class="lead">For example: “Hey, I noticed that you’ve been avoiding going to [insert location] and other social gatherings. Can you share with me what caused the change?”</p> 
        
        <p class="lead">Then, depending on how the conversation goes, you might ask if they think they need some help or support in coping with their anxiety.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Know When to Seek Help</h2>
        <p class="lead">If your loved one’s anxiety starts to impede their ability to enjoy life, interact at school, work or hang out with friends, or if it causes problems at home, then it’s time to seek professional help. Encourage a loved one to make an appointment with a mental health provider. If they’re resistant, you can remind them that it’s just one appointment. It doesn’t mean they have to commit to treatment or to working with that specific therapist. It’s really just an initial check-in, like an annual physical exam but for your mental and emotional health. </p>
